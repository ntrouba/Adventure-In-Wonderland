Final Project Reflection

1. What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
    My approach to the project was to code first and write storyline second. Though the storyline is crucial to the game, the code is the part that needs to run smoothly for the story to even be represented at all. 
2. What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    I learned that System.out.println() was not the only thing one uses to print text. There are many different variations that 
    can make the text do varying things.
3. Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
    I wish I implemented the queen's turn into her own method but I had gotten so far into the play() method that I
    decided to just keep it in there.
4. If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
    If I had unlimited time I would really like to add graphics to this game. I'm starting to self teach myself a little about
    graphics in Java but I'm not at a place yet where I could do this game justice. With more time I really feel like graphics would take this game to a new level, the visuals in Alice in Wonderland are very cool.
5. What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    During one of the code reviews in class Suany showed me slow-text method that she thought would work well for our Alice and Wonderland theme. We ended up implementing it throughout the game.
6. If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
    I started out coding a lot of things that easily could have been character attributes into the classes but realized we should just have the attributes from character work in the classes.
7. If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.
    I worked with Lily Garner and Liberty Lehr on this project and it was an overall very rewarding experience. We all were very
    excited with our game concept and even threw a movie night where we watched the Disney animated Alice in Wonderland adaptation.
    Sometimes it would be hard to meet up because we all had very hectic schedules this semester but we did a good job of working
    independtly on the project and updating each other on new things we were implementing into the game.
